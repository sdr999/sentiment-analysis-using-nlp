# sentiment-analysis-using-nlp
In this project we have done sentiment analysis using natural language processing dataset named emotion. 
The dataset consists of various words related to emotions like joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear. 
We have created a model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a given sentence. 
The model uses a bag-of-words approach, which takes into account the frequency of words and their co-occurrence with other words in a sentence. 
We have tested the model on a variety of sentences and it has been able to accurately predict the sentiment of each sentence. 
We have also evaluated the model using different metrics and it has shown high accuracy. 
The results of this project show that the model is a promising approach for sentiment analysis.
